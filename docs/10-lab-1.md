## Lab 1 - exploring HealthLake FHIR API using AWS Console

### Get familiar with HealthLake data store

If you logged out from AWS Console after the initial data store creation, log back in and navigate to AWS HealthLake service page. 

NOTE: if you see the following error during your interactions with HealthLake service in the AWS Console, refresh the page to renew the credentials.

If the left sidebar menu is hidden, expand it by clicking on a "hamburger menu". Click on *Data Stores* to open details page.

![HealthLake click to see details](/docs/assets/07-healthlake-datastore-click-details.png)

* Review the relevant details of the data store. Take a note of the endpoint, and copy it into your notes for the future reference. It will look like the following URL: `https://healthlake.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/datastore/<datastore-id>/r4/` 

### Perform a simple Search interaction

* Click on **Run Query** button

![HealthLake click on run query](/docs/assets/09-healthlake-click-on-runquery.png)

* When Run query entry form opens, prepare query parameters
1. Choose *Search with GET* as Query type
2. Choose *Patient* as Resource type
3. Click on **Run query** button

![HealthLake GET Patient query](/docs/assets/10-healthlake-get-patient-query.png)

* After the query finishes, examine the response that the service returns. You will see raw response. Scroll down to see more nicely formatted response

![HealthLake GET Patient raw](/docs/assets/11-healthlake-patient-response-1.png)

![HealthLake GET Patient formatted](/docs/assets/12-healthlake-patient-response-2.png)

* Scroll to make the beginning of the first Patient resource visible and copy the Patient resource logical id (`Patient.id`) into your notes. It will have a value of `04c704c4-5d2d-4308-9c33-1690a6e47a6b`.

### Peform a Read interaction

* Let us try Read Patient interaction. Scroll up to the top of the window and change Query type to *Read*. Paste Patient resource logical id, that you have copied in the previous step, into Resource ID field. Click on **Run query** button.

![HealthLake Read Patient query](/docs/assets/14-healthlake-read-patient-query.png)

* Scroll down to see the response, which will contain a single Patient resource.

### Operate on a FHIR Bundle resource

Download a [sample FHIR Bundle resource](/data/Patrice780_Lehner980.json), by right-clicking on the link and choosing *Save As* or its equivalent, to your local workstation.

1. Choose *Create* as Query type
2. Select *Bundle* as Resource type
3. Copy and paste the content of the FHIR Bundle resource into Request body area.
4. Click on *Run query*

![HealthLake Create Bundle form](/docs/assets/16-healthlake-create-bundle.png)

You will be able to see the confirmation that the Bundle resource was created successfully:

### Additional exploration

Feel free to experiment with additional types of FHIR interactions available in the AWS console: Create, Update (PUT), and Delete

Note: there are bulk FHIR API functions available. These are Bulk Import and Bulk Export. They are outside of the scope of this session.
