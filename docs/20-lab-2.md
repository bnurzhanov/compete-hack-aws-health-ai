## Lab 2 - Operating on FHIR data in AWS data analytics services

### Setup AWS Lake Formation Administrator

Before we can access data using AWS analytics service, [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), we need to set up necessary [AWS Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/) permissions to allow access to the data.

In this section we use AWS Lake Formation default permission handling to allow for individual access control and create a local, friendly named resource link the AWS HealthLake managed database.

By default in a new AWS Account, AWS Lake Formation will not have an administrator defined. The first time you navigate to the Lake Formation console page, a pop-up will ask you to setup your data lake administrators.

1. Navigate to the "AWS Lake Formation" page in the AWS Console. First, type "lake formation" in the search box and then click on AWS Lake Formation service name.

![Navigate to Lake Formation](/docs/assets/20-lake-formation-navigate.png)

2. A popup will appear on the console, "Welcome to Lake Formation" with 'Add Myself' selected by default. Leave this setting as-is, making yourself the default database administrator. Press the 'Get started' button.

![Set yourself as Lake Formation Admin](/docs/assets/21-lake-formation-admin-setup.png)

3. This console page will then display the "AWS Lake Formation > Administrative roles and tasks" screen. On this screen, under "Data lake administrators", you will now see the current role set to your IAM user

### Setup AWS Lake Formation Default Permissions

1. Navigate the AWS Console to the "AWS Lake Formation" page. In the left panel under the Administration section click "Data catalog settings".

![Navigate to Data Catalog settings](/docs/assets/23-lake-formation-data-catalog-1.png)

NOTE:  You can ignore an error message "You don't have permissions to access this resource." in the context of this exercise.

2. On the "Data catalog settings" screen in the "Default permissions for newly created databases and tables" section, clear / uncheck the 2 boxes labeled 'Use only IAM access control for new ...'.

![Update Data Catalog settings](/docs/assets/23-lake-formation-data-catalog-2.png)
 
3. You will see that permissions had been updated:

### Create HealthLake database link

AWS HealthLake will create a default resource link for its database that includes the database name, datastore id, and a randomly generated string. This name can be used in queries to specify the schema, and can be cumbersome when not automated. For this exercise, we will create a new resource link to the HealthLake database that will be easier for us to type and manage throughout the exercises.

1. Navigate the AWS Console to the "AWS Lake Formation" page and in the left hand panel under "Data catalog", click "Databases".

![Original view of the Lake Formation databases](/docs/assets/25-lake-formation-databases.png)

2. Click the "Create database" button.

![Create database](/docs/assets/26-lake-formation-create-database.png)

3. Enter the follow into the Create database dialog:
- Select 'Resource link'
- Enter the resource link name _healthlake_db_
- Click in and select the 'Shared database' _patientdata_...._healthlake_view_
- Click 'Create'

![Create resource link form](/docs/assets/27-lake-formation-create-resource-link.png)

4. You will newly created resource link listed with the existing databases:

### Access data using Amazon Athena analytics service

In this section we use SQL queries with [Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/) to directly query the data we imported into AWS HealthLake.

#### Amazon S3 Settings

In preparation for running Athena queries, we need to set up an S3 bucket to store output of Athena processing.

1. Navigate to [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3) service:

![Navigate to S3](/docs/assets/30-s3-navigate.png)

2. Click on __Create__ button

![S3 create bucket button](/docs/assets/31-s3-create-bucket-button.png)

S3 bucker names (as Azure storage account names) need to be globally unique. You can come up with your own bucket name (following the [bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html)). We suggest using the following scheme:
```
healthlake-hack-hour-{account number}-{region abbreviation or name}
```

You can look up AWS account number by clicking on your account name in the top right corner of the AWS console:

![Copy AWS account number](/docs/assets/32-s3-copy-aws-account.png)

Region abbreviation or name would be `use1` or `us-east-1` in case you followed the instructions and created AWS Healthlake data store in N. Virginia AWS region.

![S3 bucket name example](/docs/assets/33-s3-bucket-name.png)

Leave the rest of the settings as-is (using default values). Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on __Create bucket__.

![S3 create bucket finalize](/docs/assets/34-create-bucket-finalize.png)

#### Amazon Athena Settings

Navigate to Athena service using the search feature of AWS console:

Amazon Athena enables ad-hoc queries on the databases in your data catalogs - such as the AWS HealthLake Datastore tables. Before running queries, we need to setup the destination for query results to be saved, using the S3 bucket we created in the previous step of this lab.

![Navigate to Athena](/docs/assets/40-athena-navigate.png)

On Athena service page, if you are not on the ___Query editor___ page, expand left side navigation menu and click on __Query editor__, and then click on _Edit settings_.

![Get to Athena settings page](/docs/assets/41-athena-before-update-settings.png)

On _Manage settings_ page click on _Browse S3_ and navigate to the newly created S3 bucket.

![Browse S3 button](/docs/assets/42-athena-browse-s3-button.png)

Choose the bucket that you just created by clicking on a radio button in front of the bucket name and click _Choose_

![Choose S3 bucket](/docs/assets/43-athena-choose-s3-bucket.png)

Click on _Save_ button to assign this bucket as the destination for Athen query output.

![Save S3 bucket selection](/docs/assets/44-athena-s3-bucket-save.png)

You will be able to confirm the selection on the next screen. Click on _Editor_ tab after the confirmation.

![Athena S3 bucket confirmation](/docs/assets/45-athena-s3-bucket-confirm.png)

Optionally, you can change database to use friendlier name (resource link) that you created previously.

![Athena HealthLake resource link selection](/docs/assets/46-athena-select-resource-link.png)

Scroll down in the _Data_ pane which lists different tables until you see _patient_ table. Click on expansion menu (three vertical dots), and click on _Preview Table_.

![Athena navigate to patient table](/docs/assets/47-athena-patient-preview-selection.png)

As you can see, it will generate a simple SQL statement:
```
SELECT * FROM "healthlake_db"."patient" limit 10;
```
In the result pane below you will be able to see columnar representation of the elements of the Patient FHIR resource.

![Athena patient table preview output](/docs/assets/48-athena-patient-preview-results.png)

Let us try a more complex query. Copy and paste the following SQL statement in the query editor form, replacing the original content.
```
SELECT patient.id as patientId
, CONCAT(name [ 1 ].family, ' ', name [ 1 ].given [ 1 ]) as name
, (year(current_date) - year(date(birthdate))) AS age
, gender as gender
, CAST(json_extract(patient.extension[1], '$.extension[0].valueCoding.display') AS VARCHAR) as race
, CAST(json_extract(patient.extension[2], '$.extension[0].valueCoding.display') AS VARCHAR) as ethnicity
, maritalstatus.coding[1].display as maritalstatus
, address[1].line[1] as addressline
, address[1].city as city
, address[1].district as district
, address[1].state as state
, address[1].postalcode as postalcode
, address[1].country as country
, CAST(json_extract(address[1].extension[1], '$.extension[0].valueDecimal') AS VARCHAR) as latitude
, CAST(json_extract(address[1].extension[1], '$.extension[1].valueDecimal') AS VARCHAR) as longitude
FROM "healthlake_db"."patient"
```

![Athena a more complex patient query](/docs/assets/49-athena-patient-complex-query.png)

You can review the output of the query in the _Query results_ pane after it finishes.

Athena allows more complex SQL queries, including joining different tables (including from separate databases). A simple example that you can run follows:
```
SELECT p.name, e.status
FROM patient AS p
JOIN encounter AS e
ON p.id = SPLIT(e.subject.reference, '/')[2]
WHERE e.status = 'finished'
LIMIT 5
```

You can experiment with additional queries after the session.
